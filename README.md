A decision tree is a flowchart-like tree structure where an internal node represents feature(or attribute), the branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf node represents the outcome. This flowchart-like structure helps us in decision making.

Thiss why decision trees are easy to understand and interpret.
<p> <h3> Parameters </h3> </p>
<ul>
  <li><b>min_samples_split</b></li>
  (default value = 2)
  nodes cannot be further seperated below this value. 
  <li><b> Entropy</b></li>
  It controls how a Decision Tree decides where to split the data. 
  It is the measure of<b>impurity</b> in a bunch of examples.
